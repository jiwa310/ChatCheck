# ChatCheck
ChatCheck is a Chrome Extension that assigns a chess engine move to each text message response on Discord. It also provides short feedback to ensure each message results in a brilliant move.

We built the chrome extension using JavaScript and deployed it using chrome for developers. To make an API call to OpenAI we hosted a Node.js server on Railway. In order to modify discord we used DOM manipulation. The popup for the extension was built using JavaScript as well.
